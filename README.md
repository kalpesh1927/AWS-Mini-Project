# AWS Mini-Project: Cloud Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to build a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure using various AWS services.

## Key Features
- **Role-Based Access Control (IAM)**: Secured AWS resources by implementing IAM roles and policies.
- **Cost Monitoring**: Implemented billing alarms to track and stay within my AWS budget.
- **Data Storage with Amazon S3**: Used Amazon S3 to store and manage data securely.
- **EC2 Instances**: Deployed EC2 instances to host applications.
- **Network Security with Security Groups**: Configured security groups to restrict access.
- **Data Backup with Volumes & Snapshots**: Utilized EBS volumes and snapshots to backup critical data.
- **Custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**: Created AMIs for custom EC2 setups.
- **Load Balancers**: Set up load balancers to distribute traffic across instances for high availability.
- **Auto Scaling**: Configured Auto Scaling to adjust resources based on demand.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed databases for scalable, high-performance applications.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2**: Deployed and managed virtual machines to run applications.
- **Amazon S3**: Configured storage for secure data management.
- **IAM**: Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for security.
- **RDS**: Used AWS RDS for scalable, managed database solutions.
- **CloudFormation**: Automated infrastructure deployment.
- **Auto Scaling**: Configured dynamic scaling based on traffic load.
- **AWS CLI**: Used AWS CLI for managing resources programmatically.

These tools helped me build a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and deploy AWS resources:

1. Create an AWS account (if you don't have one).
2. Set up IAM roles and policies as described.
3. Deploy EC2 instances, security groups, and set up S3 for data storage.
4. Configure load balancers, scaling policies, and RDS for databases.
5. Use the `cloudformation/` folder (if you used AWS CloudFormation) to deploy infrastructure automatically.

## How to Use
You can clone the repository to explore the AWS configurations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalpesh1927/AWS-Mini-Project.git
